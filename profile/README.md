The Writer's Workshop Bangladesh is the ultimate place to express your creativity!

## Our Story

The Writers Workshop started as an idea by our honorable founder Mahashat Rahman.
He proposed the idea to our co-founder and web developer Moheshwar Amarnath Biswas.
Moheshwar started working on it. He chose Astro.js as the web framework.
It's the best (as of 29/Nov/2023) web framework for building websites like us.
He combined Astro.js with Tailwind CSS to build the best possible website for us.
